# DRIVER-DROWSINESS-DETECTION
Distracted drivers have always been one of the biggest reason for road accidents. Drunken driving has accounted for 30% of car accident fatalities between 2005- 2014. Cell phone use during driving has become an all-time winner with 38% percent of its contribution in road accidents. There are other reasons like driver fatigue and drowsiness that accounts to road accidents.
In this project we attempt to reduce the chances of driver getting distracted by giving life saving alerts to the driver by sensing potentially dangerous or distracting activities like drinking, smoking and cell phone usage. The system can also predict drowsiness by the eye openness state of the driver. In addition to driver's distraction, we also attempt totrack the obstruction caused on the roads by tracking the number of times dangerous overtaking has been done by the driver or by other vehicles and thereby decipher the number plate.
The system also tracks other obstructions like pits and animals crossing the road. We attempt to use opencv a very famous computer vision library in python,tensorflow and YOLO - a real time object detection algorithm.
